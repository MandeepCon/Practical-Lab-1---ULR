    "Throught the assignment, I am using the univariate linear regression on the California housing dataset to perform the correlation between the median house values and three independent variables. Such as **median income, population and number of households**. I will be evaluting the individual predictive ability of each predictor by analyzing and accessing the different models of the regression. Afterwords, I will identify the variable that influence the home prices more. Throughtout this statistical techniques and data visualization to provide a clear, data-driven insights essential to the trends in california real estate market. "
